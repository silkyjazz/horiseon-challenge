# horiseon-challenge

## Description

The premise of the horiseon challenge was to identify the semantic and non-seemeantic elements. After identifying the non-seemantic elements, the goal was to then replace those elements with semantic elements that abide by the Web Accessibility Innitiative. Using the correct or appropriate semantic elements allows the web browser to be read correctly and coherently by screen readers. 

Majority of the content was sitting inside a div, sitting inside a div. By looking at the html documentation I was able to implement to correct semantic elements without affect the styling of the webpage.

During this challenge I learned about some issues that users with disabilties may face if the webpage isn't properly coded with semantic elements. Issues include but aren't limited to; inability to use the internet equally, unable to participate in class (if using the internet to submit assignments or participate, unable to see captions on videos for hard of hearing users), inability to read data and get information.
